An Anki add-on that allows to create a filtered deck for each real deck you have and for each deck and some search term. E.g. this allows you to study all due cards in the order created and if you sync after deck creation to mobile also on mobile. I would only do this with the "Anki 2.1 scheduler (beta)" because the default scheduler resets cards in learning when you empty or rebuild a filterd deck.

This might also be useful if you want to sort all overdue cards by their overdueness per deck, see e.g. the Anking video <a href="https://youtu.be/UXgck-g0nQA?t=747" rel="nofollow">Anki:How to Miss a Day (making up skipped days or studying ahead without a penalty)</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/amj7iw/an_efficient_method_for_catching_up_on_anki/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. For details see <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__batch_create_filtered_decks/blob/master/src/config.md" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Use this at your own risk.
